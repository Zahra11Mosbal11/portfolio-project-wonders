## My Journey to E-commerce Development: A Personal Story
I've always been fascinated by the digital world. Growing up, I spent countless hours exploring websites, tinkering with basic coding, and dreaming about creating something impactful online. This passion for technology and innovation stayed with me as I pursued my studies and eventually led me to a career in web development, however, my journey towards working on this e-commerce project began during a particularly challenging time in my life.
My sister and I decided to start an online shop because the cost of rent was too high. We created a small website to help us get started, and over time, our shop grew bigger and our website flourished into a thriving business.

• We built our site using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and NoSQL. 

• Key platforms include GitHub and Netlify for deployment.
